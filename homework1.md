# **Homework 1**
## **TeamE**
1. If there are past booking pending of payment, no booking in advance is allowed: we want to ask if the phrase "past booking" means the previous booking or the current booking. For example, if we want to book 2 courts at the same time, and we have not paid for the first booking yet so we can not book the second court. Is that true?
2. Is user able to book 3 courts at 3 different sport centers at the same time?
