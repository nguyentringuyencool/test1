# **Homework 1**
## **TeamE**
1. If there are past booking pending of payment, no booking in advance is allowed: we want to ask if the phrase "past booking" means the previous booking or the current booking. For example, if we want to book 2 courts at the same time, and we have not paid for the first booking yet so we can not book the second court. Is that true?
2. The initial requirement said that one user can book maximum three courts in advance but no advance booking is allowed when there is any pending of payment. So we want to ask what will happen if a user want to book three courts at three different sport centers.
